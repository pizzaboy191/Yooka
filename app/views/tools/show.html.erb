      Less stress translates to less anxiety.
      For example, an eight-week study of mindfulness meditation helped participants reduce their anxiety.
      It also reduced symptoms of anxiety disorders, such as phobias, social anxiety, paranoid thoughts, obsessive-compulsive behaviors and panic attacks (9).
